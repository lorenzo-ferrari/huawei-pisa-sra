The Resource Manager is a script that:
Manages a storage of resources (an “editable” file)
Manages the status of the resources (free/locked)
Books a free resource for the user that requests it
Frees a locked resource when the user stops using it
Returns a free resource or a failure
Logs its activity to a log file
When an user is allowed to use a resource the Resource Manager sends the properties referring to that resource to the requesting user
NOT SUPPORTED:
Unlocks automatically a locked resource if the user does not respect some condition
Keeps a prioritized queue of users requesting a resource or a resource with a particular property
Exposes a web interface to lock/free resources
